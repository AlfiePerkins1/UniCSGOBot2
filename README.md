# UniCSGOBot

A Discord bot written in Javascript that allows the user to find stats for themselves or other players who have participated in [NSE (National Student Esports)](https://www.nse.gg/) or [NUEL (National University Esports League)](https://thenuel.com/).

During this project I used and gained a vareity of skills inlcuding web scraping in Javascript as well as Async functions. I also used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the primary database for storing specific server configs which allowed server owners and admins to customize the bot in the way they saw fit.

 NSE stats accessed by +nsestats NSEUSERNAME



## Todo

-Edit config command
